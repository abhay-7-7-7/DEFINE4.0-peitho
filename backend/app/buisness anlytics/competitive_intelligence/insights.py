"""
Competitive Intelligence - Rule-Based Insight Generator

Evaluates the seller's competitive position and generates actionable insights.

DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Pure rules, no ML, no external API calls
- Each rule is an independent evaluator function
- Insights have severity levels: info, warning, success, critical
- Insights have categories for frontend grouping
- All evaluators receive the same context dict and return 0+ insights
- Easy to add new rules: just add a function to EVALUATORS list
