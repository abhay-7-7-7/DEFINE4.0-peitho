LLM Response Validator

CRITICAL SAFETY LAYER — ensures LLM output:
1. Never invents prices or numbers
2. Never contradicts the pricing decision
3. Contains the correct offer/price values
4. Stays within acceptable length
5. Doesn't contain harmful content

If validation fails, the system falls back to templates.
